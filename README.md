# KnighTracker

An application that helps users to track their weights over time.
Users can enter their weight, edit or delete the entry.
The history can be seen in the form of a timeline, and they can click on it to edit their measurement entry.
Also, this history is used to be shown in a graph that gives the user a nice statistic of their measurement history.
